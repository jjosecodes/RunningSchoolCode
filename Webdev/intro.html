    <p>
      Hello! My name is Jose Jobins, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the 
      University of Houston–Downtown, where I am on track to graduate in December 2025. My academic journey has 
      given me a strong foundation in computer science concepts, particularly in data structures, algorithms, and 
      software engineering. I am deeply passionate about building practical, impactful technology that makes people’s 
      lives easier and more productive.
